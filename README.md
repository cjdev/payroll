## Payroll Exercise

### Requirements (each will need many tests)
- Salaried employees are paid on the last day of the month, according to their monthly salary
- Hourly employees are paid every friday, according to their hourly rate and hours worked
- Commissioned employees are paid on the 15th and the last day of the month, according to their sales and commission rate

### Your pairing partner
- Understands everything about the language and libraries
- If you can precisely articulate your intent, your pairing partner can help you with the syntax
- Can explain anything about how the code is, but not how the code should be
- Is not much help when it comes to design, you will have to take the lead on this

### Getting Started
- Start out by having a look at [PayrollServiceTest](src/test/java/payroll/PayrollServiceTest.java)
- Or if you are in coderpad, look at the [whenThereAreNoEmployeesNobodyShouldBePaid](payroll-coderpad.java) test in the [coderpad version](payroll-coderpad.java)
